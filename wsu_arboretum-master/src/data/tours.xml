<Description>Aster is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Coming from an Ancient Greek word, meaning "star", the name refers to the shape of the flower head. Containing many species and varieties, this family is popular as garden plants because of their attractive and colorful flowers. Native Americans used the leaves of some aster plants for brewing a tea for headaches and thought the smoke from burning aster plants was helpful in reviving a person who had fainted.</Description>

Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their food grain seed, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. These plants are beneficial to native plant gardens because they help enhance the nitrogen fixation in soils by soil rhizobium (beneficial bacteria).</Description>
